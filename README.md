# drawing_SVGs_with_DFT
We explore this idea by taking a shape stored as an SVG path, sampling it as a sequence of points, treating them as complex numbers. Apply the Discrete Fourier Transform to extract the frequency components, reconstruct the drawing using a finite number of epicycles. Turns a SVG into a object that can be decomposed, and drawn using a Fourier series.
